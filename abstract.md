% Adaptative peak shifts with stress-induced mutagenesis
% Yoav Ram & Lilach Hadany

In 1931 Sewall Wright presented a problem: how can a population cross a fitness valley and shift from an adaptive peak to a higher one? Wright's problem is still an open question in evolutionary biology despite his own "shifting-balance theory" and other attempts to resolve it. 
Stress-induced mutation, the process in which maladapted individuals increase their mutation rate, has been demonstrated in numerous species, both prokaryote and eukaryote. In addition, we have previously demonstrated that it should evolve by natural selection and that it increases the mean fitness of populations.
Here we analyze a population genetic model of a rugged adaptive landscape. We derive analytical expressions that show that stress-induced mutation increases the adaptation rate and present the results of stochastic simulations that validate our analytic expressions. Our results suggest that stress-induced mutagenesis can resolve the problem of adaptive peak shifts and that stress-induced mutagenesis enchances the evolvability of populations.
